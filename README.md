*Izuku Midoriya is a boy who wishes to become a hero just like his idol, All Might, however lacking a Quirk makes the dream feel impossible, and makes him an easy target for bullying, like from his childhood friend, Katsuki Bakugo. However, after an incident where Izuku meets All Might, he proves himself worthy of becoming a hero, and is chosen as All Might's successor to inherit his Quirk, One For All, which allows him to get accepted to U.A. High School, and learn how to become a true hero.*

 **My Favorite Character**

- Shoto Todoroki

**Biography** 

 A serious but well-meaning student enrolled by recommendation, Shoto is the son of Endeavor (Enji Todoroki), a famous hero ranking behind only All Might himself.
His Quirk is "Half-Cold Half-Hot", which allows him to generate and control large amounts of fire and ice from his left and right sides respectively, the former of which he inherited from his father and the latter from his mother. Raised by Endeavor for the sole purpose of surpassing All Might, Todoroki hates how his father only views him as a tool and had originally vowed to become the number one hero without ever using his fire abilities as a form of rebellion.

**Quirk/Powers**

Half-Cold Half-Hot: Shoto's Quirk grants him both pyro and cryokinesis, essentially allowing him control over fire and ice (from his left and right sides). Although with him rejecting his fire abilities, Todoroki shows more finesse with the ice side of his Quirk, he is able to instantly generate large constructs of ice, while unable to manipulate it he can use his power in a myriad of ways, including him freezing opponents, creating pillars and shields of ice to block attacks.
After accepting to use his flames, which he only used beforehand to melt his ice, Todoroki has shown to have difficulty learning how to control them but soon manages to get a better handle over his fire abilities. Todoroki has also been able to use both powers at once, although this proves to be difficult and perhaps unwise given that it dulls his movements.

By using both halves of his Quirk, Shoto is able to create super-heated blast by first using his right side to cool the air then quickly switches to his left side to heat the air creating a heated blast. By using both halves throughout his body he is able to merge the two halves creating an "X" shaped flame on his chest. This allows him to create both a flame that is both Hot and Cold.

If Shoto overuses either his ice or fire, then he will come to suffer from either frostbite or heatstroke, meaning that Shoto must regulate his temperature between the two. A reason that Endeavor was thankful for Shoto being born with both his and Rei's Quirk was that they could be used to counter each other's weaknesses.
